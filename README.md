Exercise 2 – High level test areas

Think about the most important areas of the cwjobs.co.uk website and give a high level overview of the areas you think require the most testing and why. We expect to see about half an hour worth of work.


Ans: Most test areas

1)	User log in and add jobs to basket and apply all in one go
2)	Up on initial homepage filter user will land on test results.
3)	On left side menu “facet-list” filters are more usable for data filters
4)	User can select multiple filters on existed filter data to get wanted results
5)	User can apply filters and remove filters whenever they want
